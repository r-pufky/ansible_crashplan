# CPU           Memory     Disk
# 2c/4t @2.0Ghz 1GB/TB     6GB (includes OS)
#
# Memory requirements are for the largest backup setup, allowing for OS usage.
# 6TB backup set = 6GB + 1GB for OS = 7GB memory. Use crashplan_memory.
#
# Crashplan will crash if there is not enough memory for the backup set being
# indexed.
#
# Remote connection setup:
#
# Container
# ---------
# PVE will try to forward to own displays if `X11UseLocalhost yes` is enabled
# for containers (lxc/kvm).
#
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
#
#   X11UseLocalhost no
#
#      Connect remotely to GUI for backup adoption:
#
# Windows
# -------
# xlaunch:
#   * multiple windows
#   * display windows: -1
#   * start no client
#   * clipboard (checked), primary selection (checked)
#   * native opengl (checked)
#
# putty:
#   connection -> ssh -> x11
#   * enable x11 forwarding (checked)
#   * x display location: localhost:0.0
#   * MIT-Magic-Cookie-1 (checked)
#
# Linux
# -----
# ssh: no configuration required. Just xserver running.
#
# Run GUI:
#
#   ssh -X {USER}@{HOST}
#   /usr/local/crashplan/bin/desktop.sh
#
# Backup set Adoption:
# * Start container.
# * Sign in to your account.
# * Click the Replace Existing button to start the wizard.
# * **SKIP** File Transfer.
# * Once done with the wizard, go to your device's details and click Manage
#   Files. You will probably see missing items in the file selection. This is
#   normal, since path to your files may be different in the container.
# * Update the file selection by re-adding your files. Do not unselect missing
#   items yet.
# * Perform a backup. Because of deduplication, files will not be uploaded
#   again.
# * Once the backup is terminated, you can remove missing items if you don't
#   care about file versions. Else, keep missing items.

# TODO(release-bug): 11.x.x currently segfaults with JVM after authentication.
#     This is a known issue as stated by one of the developers and a fix is
#     underway. Until this is fixed, stay on 10.x.x installations -- 11 will
#     **NOT** work. Set crashplan_auto_upgrades: false
